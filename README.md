An array is a fundamental data structure in programming that allows you to store a collection of elements of the same data type in a contiguous memory location. It provides a convenient way to group related data, making it easier to manage and manipulate large sets of information. In most programming languages, including C++, arrays are indexed, which means each element is accessed using a numerical position. Arrays are widely used for tasks such as storing lists of numbers, characters, or objects, and they play a crucial role in various algorithms and data processing tasks. Understanding arrays is fundamental for any programmer, as they serve as a building block for more complex data structures and data manipulation operations.
